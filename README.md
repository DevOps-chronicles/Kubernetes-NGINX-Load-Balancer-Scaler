# Kubernetes-NGINX-Load-Balancer-Scaler
This repository contains the code and configuration files to set up a scalable and highly available application using Kubernetes and NGINX as the load balancer. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to efficiently manage and scale applications in a production environment using open-source tools.

## Prerequisites
* A basic understanding of Kubernetes and its components such as Pods, Replication Controllers, and Services.
* A working Kubernetes cluster.
* Familiarity with NGINX, its configuration files, and load balancing techniques.
* Familiarity with Docker and containerization of applications.
## Features
* Automated deployment of applications using Kubernetes.
* Load balancing of incoming traffic using NGINX.
* Automatic scaling of application replicas based on resource utilization.
* High availability of applications through replication and self-healing of Pods.
* Flexibility in managing and updating application versions.
## Architecture
The architecture of this project consists of the following components:

* Kubernetes Cluster: This is the foundation of the project, which provides the platform to manage and scale applications.
* Docker Image: The application is packaged as a Docker image and stored in a Docker registry such as Docker Hub.
* Replication Controller: The Replication Controller ensures that the specified number of replicas of the application is always running.
* NGINX Load Balancer: NGINX is deployed as a LoadBalancer Service in Kubernetes, which routes incoming traffic to the application replicas.
## Deployment Steps
* Clone the repository.
* Build the Docker image for the application and push it to a Docker registry.
* Update the Replication Controller definition with the Docker image details.
* Deploy the Replication Controller and NGINX LoadBalancer Service to the Kubernetes cluster.
* Verify the deployment by accessing the application using the LoadBalancer IP or hostname.
* Scaling the Application
* The application can be scaled by updating the Replication Controller definition with the desired number of replicas and applying the changes to the Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes will automatically create or remove replicas as per the updated definition.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the simplicity and efficiency of deploying and scaling applications using Kubernetes and NGINX. The use of open-source tools and containerization makes it possible to manage and scale applications in a flexible and cost-effective manner.
